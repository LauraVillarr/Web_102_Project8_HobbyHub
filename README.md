The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

I had a lot of issues getting the format of my website to look the way that I wanted it. The designs were the part that took me the longest out of everything so
I could get it to look the way I wanted to. I also had some issues with getting the comments to work. I decided to use a separate table for comments since I couldn't
understand placing them as an array. Finally, I had some issues getting my extra feature (the suggested posts) to work properly. I had some issues in choosing the random
posts, and in linking to a different postDetails page. I realized that in order to link to a different postDetails page with a different id, I needed to completely
refresh the page in order for the data to load properly, so on click I did a refresh of the page but with the new data.
